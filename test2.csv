Prior studies of mantle flow patterns [9–11], as well as works prioritizing mantle convection visualization [1,3,6–8,13], have employed time-varying 2D slices, 3D isosurfaces, or volume rendering for the visualization of univariate scalar fields and glyph-based techniques for flow visualization. We demonstrate the use of feature level-sets (isosurface-based multivariate data visualization technique), attribute-filtered integral curves (streamlines and pathlines), and topological analysis to study mantle flow patterns. We briefly describe each of these approaches in Section 2, and present our finding using these methods in Section 3.",896458013039267861,https://discord.com/channels/884159773287805038/896458013039267861
