		"Summary": "Iron-Blooded Orphans follows the exploits of a group of juvenile soldiers who establish their own security company after rebelling against the adults who betrayed them on a futuristic, terraformed Mars. The series deals with several real-life problems such as war, slavery, child soldiers, poverty, neo-colonialism, and corruption. The catchphrase of the series is 'The sustenance of life is on the battlefield.' (いのちの糧は、戦場にある。, Inochi no kate wa, senjō ni aru.)"
